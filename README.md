# nickname_hunter

A script to politely simulate an attempt to take the desired nickname in the online game **Mafia Online**,  
if it is temporarily used by another player. The script periodically checks the availability of the nickname  
and informs you when it becomes available.  

⚠️ Note: This script **does not harm or interfere with other players**. It only waits until a nickname is released  
by someone who changes theirs — at which point it may claim it for you.
